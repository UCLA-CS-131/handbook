### Spring 2023

This was the first quarter where TAs taught all 10 weeks.

- 1D: [Siddarth's Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1reoZyngip1yxw8TV61R9nQ6nouwzphTO)

### Fall 2022

Due to the [Fall 2022 UC Academic Workers strike](https://dailybruin.com/tag/uc-academic-worker-strike-2022), the slides for this quarter are incomplete (only up to Week 6).

## Practice Problems

Many of the slides contain practice problems (for example, Matt wrote ~ 2 a week in Spring 2023). Here are some extra curated sources of problems:

- [H-99: 99 Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems); questions 1-41 and 61-73 are doable with the course material.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) both feature practice problems that lend themselves for great functional programming practice, and are an alternative to traditional leetcode.

## Misc

- In Matt's F2022 and S2023 discussions, he spotlighted a [Person of the Week](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16D15G5mHISjh9VNblDAefQe-dUfYyLVc7M5L0go2WSc/edit#slide=id.p) and [Language of the Week](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rHQ9pHZI1mp9ROkIkbikpx8a6bIsb_1Fntk9jhZstUw/edit#slide=id.p) each discussion. The goal is to introduce new people/concepts and emphasize the real-world impacts of programming languages and computer science.
- Eggert's 131 resources are also helpful in that they have some overlap. For example, [Matt's slides for W2023](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mn0k9ah2MLdC0wP_aQh-jyMna9mlHIG7) have overlapping practice problems and a template for a [final review session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DWshoMdEATq1A2x5WdNkEPZFh-cK2wBpBGlpb0xpkE/edit).
