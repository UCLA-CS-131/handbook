# CS 131 TA Handbook

This is a TA handbook for UCLA COM SCI 131. The idea is that a new TA could read this website and know how to run the infrastructure for the class.

For [Carey Nachenberg](http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/)'s offering of the class, it details:

- a set of playbooks for what to do when:
  - the quarter starts
  - a new project is created (Gradescope, barista, ...)
  - a new project is completed (i.e. needs to be graded, solutions published)
  - a resource needs to be updated on the course site (homework, project spec, lecture slides, exams, schedule)
- a comprehensive overview of various course infrastructure systems:
  - the autograder (and Gradescope)
  - the course website
  - barista
  - advanced topics & wish lists for the above

In addition, it links to past resources developed by the TAs.
