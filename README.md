# CS 131 TA Handbook

This is a TA handbook for ([Carey Nachenberg](http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/)'s) UCLA COM SCI 131. The idea is that a new TA could read this website and know how to run the infrastructure for the class. It features playbooks for all TA responsibilities, provides extra information on various areas of course infrastructure, and links to past TA resources.

For more information, [visit the site itself](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/handbook/).
