# Misc. Website Updates

A quick set of sections on how to update various areas of the course website! Most of these relate to features of [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class).

{: .important }

This playbook assumes you've already completed the [Getting Started]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/) guide.

## Syllabus and Course Calendar

Updating the syllabus is relatively simple; navigate to `syllabus.md`, and edit the relevant markdown and HTML. If you haven't already, you may want to read about [GFM's support for tables](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-) and the [`<details>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details), which significantly help with formatting.

The course calendar page is generated from the `_modules` folder (in Jekyll, this is a special type of folder called a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)). As a TA you should only have to edit, add, or delete lines; without going into details, the simplest advice we can give you is to "mess around" and see what works.

```

Observe the use of the `.label` class (and different colors) to differentiate line items.

On top of Just the Class, Matt wrote a feature to filter in/out entries based on their associated label. The filtering feature assumes that the labels are one of `['Lecture', 'Section', 'Posted', 'Due', 'Exam']`.

## Weekly Schedule

The weekly schedule is generated by the YAML file in `_schedules/weekly.yml`. Generally, each "event" in the calendar has four associated keys: a `name`, `start`, `end`, and `location`. The `start` and `end` determine the position for the event within the day it's centered under.

There are a few things to keep in mind with the weekly schedule:

- it doesn't handle having many events overlapping (either partially or completely); see [#29 in the Just the Class repo](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/issues/29) for more information
- the colours for items in the schedule are based on the slug of the `name` of the event. If you want the colour to be something that's not gray, you should add a custom class. See `_sass/custom/schedule.scss` for examples.

## Staff Page

The staff page is generated from files in the `_staffers` collection. To add a new staffer, make a new Markdown page with the relevant front matter (`name`, `role`, `photo`, `email`). The photo should be placed in `assets/images`.

```md
---
name: Matt Wang
role: Teaching Assistant
email: matt@matthewwang.me
website: https://matthewwang.me
photo: matt.jpg
---

[Schedule an appointment](https://mattxw.com/cal); **please check with Matt first!**
```

Any content placed in the *body* of the Markdown file will be rendered in the line under the TA's name + role.


## New Sidebar Links

Links to *internal* pages in the sidebar should generally be automatic (i.e., any page you make with `layout: default` or a layout that inherits it will automatically render within the sidebar). You can edit the order of the links in the sidebar using the `nav_order` front matter variable, which takes in a number; the sidebar is sorted in ascending order.

Links to *external* pages in the sidebar are configured in `_config.yml`. To add a new page, add a new entry to the `nav_external_links` key with a `url` and `title`. **For changes to be reflected, you need to restart your dev server --- i.e. re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve`**.

## Other Elements

This isn't a comprehensive guide to editing the entire site! If you're wondering how to edit a specific element, we first suggest:

1. finding the source file for that page; is it easy to understand?
2. if not, consult the documentation for:
    - [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com)
    - [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class)
    - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
