# Beginning of Quarter

This playbook runs through everything you need to do to set up the course infrastructure at the start of the quarter.

{: .note }

Do the [Getting Started]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/) first!

{: .no_toc }

## Table of Contents

{:toc}

- dummy item

{::options toc_levels="2..4" /}

## External Services

The course uses a handful of external services, some of which you'll need Carey's help to do. Before you proceed, you should:

- ask Carey to set up the class's [Bruinlearn](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/); we only use this for course announcements + directing students to the course website.
- set up the [Gradescope](gradescope.com) instance for this class. **This should be doable through Bruinlearn's Gradescope tab.**
- set up a class discussion forum. We've used [CampusWire](https://campuswire.com/) in the past, but you can use whatever option you'd prefer; we suggest [avoiding Piazza due to privacy concerns](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/10/04/concerned-with-piazzas-data-privacy-management-some-professors-look-to-alternative-discussion-forums/).
- make sure that all TAs (including you!) have access to the [class's GitHub Organization](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131). Carey is an admin and can invite people.
- the TA shared drive. This is *different* from a normal "shared folder". It will contain all public and private materials for the course. Ask Carey for access.
