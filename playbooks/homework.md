# Homework Lifecycle

This playbook runs through everything you need to do to manage a homework, from setup to sending out grades. It *does not* cover how to write a good homework; that'll be up to you and Carey to decide!

{: .important }

This playbook assumes you've already completed the [Getting Started]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/) guide.
