# End of Quarter

A small checklist of things to do as you wrap up the quarter!

## Reflection

This is not directly related to infrastructure, but it's helpful to formally reflect on how the quarter went. There's a broad gamut of reasonable questions, but here are ones that we suggest:

- from student feedback, what were:
  - the highlights of the course; how can we preserve these?
  - pain points; out of these, which are immediately actionable?
- for TAs and teaching staff:
  - what was easier than expected? harder?
  - what systems are working well, and what aren't? are these systems fixable?
  - what do you wish someone told you at the beginning of the quarter?
- for each new strategy/program/"thing" we tried this quarter:
  - did it achieve its objective? what went well?
  - what didn't go well? how much of this is because it's the first time it's being done, versus an endemic problem?
  - should we continue this next time? why or why not?

## Updating Documentation

This is a great time to skim through all of the documentation we provide, and make sure that it's up-to-date before you hand it off to the next TAs! This includes:

- the playbooks (and other content) *on this site*!
- repository READMEs (especially for the barista one, which is never re-made)

This is a crucial step in preserving knowledge across iterations of the class, which is especially important given TA turnover!

## Archiving Repositories

Once the quarter is in and the grades are submitted, it's a good idea to [archive all the repositories related to each quarter](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories). Usually, this is:

- the course website, e.g. `spring-23`
- the project starter, e.g. `spring-23-project-starter`
- the (public) autograder, e.g. `spring-23-autograder`
